## Data Science and Nuclear Engineering: A Perfect Match
#### Madicken Munk

Invited Seminar, University of Florida
February 19, 2020

Data Science is filled with exciting, interdisciplinary work in industry and
academia. But how does it relate to nuclear engineering? In this talk, Dr.
Madicken Munk will talk about different stages in her career and how computing
has allowed her to pivot her research to align with emerging areas of interest.
Each stage will be accompanied with a discussion about how computing has
informed important decisions in the engineering process, and what the nuclear
engineering and data science fields can learn from one another. Finally, Dr.
Munk will share her perspective on emerging data science issues in nuclear
engineering and how they relate to larger issues in the data science community.

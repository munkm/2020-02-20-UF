## Tools for Transformation: Computational Methods and Modeling in Nuclear Engineering
#### Madicken Munk

Invited Seminar, University of Wisconsin, Madison
April 15, 2019

Computational tools are our first step to model, design, and study innovative nuclear
technologies, eventually bringing these technologies to licensing and deployment.
Each stage of computational tool development--from implementing numerical methods
to modeling and analysis--has unique design requirements. This talk covers three different
computational tools: including a coupled neutronics/structural mechanics method
using MCNP and COMSOL; FW/CADIS-Î©, a hybrid method for deep-penetration neutron
transport; and widgyts, a tool to interactively explore volumetric data.
Each will be complemented by a discussion of how the tool both expands and
provides limited insight into our data.
